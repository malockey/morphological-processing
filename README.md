## Morphological Processing 

### Erosion: 

```
Implement your own version of erosion in function format, with the ability to work with different structuring
elements (size and shape) and apply the algorithms in the figure ImagesMorphology/Fig0905(a)(wirebond-mask)
```

### Dilation

```
Implement your own version of function format dilation, with the ability to work with different structuring
elements (size and shape) and apply the algorithms in the figure ImagesMorphology/Fig0907(a)(text_gaps_1_and_2_pixels)
```

### Apply sobel

```
Apply your edge detection algorithm (roberts or sobel) to the ImagesMorphology/Fig0905(a)(wirebond-mask) image
before and after using dilation/erosion and report the results.
